# Plyr-React Integration with Subtitles and Time Update Using `useImperativeHandle`

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate the `plyr-react` package with a video player component and show a timer that updates in real-time based on the video's playback time. It also includes how to use subtitles with a video and a custom timer component that is updated using the `useImperativeHandle` hook from React.

## Key Features

- **Video Player**: Implements the `plyr-react` video player component for seamless video playback.
- **Subtitles**: Adds subtitles to the video using WebVTT format for easy integration.
- **Real-Time Timer**: Displays the current playback time of the video with a custom formatted timer that updates as the video plays.
- **`useImperativeHandle` Hook**: Utilizes the `useImperativeHandle` hook to allow the custom timer component to update based on the current playback time of the video.
